As part of the Work Readiness programme, we completed a career-related personality exercise/quiz provided by the lecturer.
The exercise included questions about personal attributes, strengths, interests, and preferred work environments.
This helped us understand our potential career paths and how our personality aligns with different ICT roles.

Situation:
As part of the Work Readiness programme, we were required to complete a personality quiz designed to help us understand our
strengths and preferred work styles.

Task:
The task was to answer a series of career-related personality questions and use the results to reflect on how suitable
we are for different ICT career paths.

Action:
I completed the quiz honestly, analysed the results, and compared them with the skills and roles in the ICT field. I reflected 
on how my personal traits connect to roles like software development, problem-solving, and team collaboration.

Result:
The quiz showed that I have strengths in analytical thinking, focus, and adaptability. These qualities align well with careers
such as Software Developer, Full-Stack Developer, or Systems Analyst. This helped me understand which roles best fit my personality
and where I can perform at my best.
